      <h1>Genefinderx9000</h1>
      <h3>Problem ID: genefinderx9000</h3>
    </div>Bobby is a biology researcher with a great interest in
    genetics.<br>
    He loves to wander out in the wild collecting new DNA samples
    for his database which he later uses for his research.<br>
    He has to find exact matches to genetic patterns in the DNA of
    the animals he has collected. However, it takes Bobby multiple
    weeks to manually check which animals contain the exact
    sequences of DNA he is looking for, so he could use a little
    help.<br>
    Your task is to write a program that Bobby can use to find all
    the animals that contain a specific DNA sequence in his
    database. <span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{equation}
    \label{1} \alpha = \{ \textrm{'A','C','T','G'}\}
    \end{equation}</span>
    <h3>Input</h3>
    <p>The first line of input has a single integer <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$\textrm{I}$</span> the number of animals in
    the database.<br>
    Each of the following <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$\textrm{I}$</span> lines depicts the genes
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{animal}_\textrm {n}\,
    $</span>as an unique non-empty string.<br>
    The combined length of the <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$\textrm{I}$</span> animals is promised to
    never exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^6$</span>.<br>
    Following the <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{I}$</span>
    lines is a single integer <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$\textrm{K}$</span>. The next <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$\textrm{K}$</span> lines depicts a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{query}_\textrm
    {k}$</span> as an unique non-empty string. The total length of
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{K}$</span> queries
    is promised to never exceed <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$10^6$</span>.<br>
    <br>
    Both the <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{I}$</span>
    animals and the <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$\textrm{K}$</span> queries consist
    exclusively of characters from the gene alphabet <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$\alpha $</span> (see equation 1).</p>
    <h3>Output</h3>
    <p>Given a database of animal genes you are to output the
    answer to each query on a single line.<br>
    For simplicity the animals are numbered from <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$I-1$</span>.<br>
    The answer to <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$\textrm{query}_\textrm {k}$</span> should be
    given as <span class="tex2jax_process">$Z \, \, z_0 \, \cdots
    \, \textrm{z}_{\textrm{Z}-1}$</span>, where <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$Z$</span> denotes the count<br>
    of animals containing the <span class="rmfamily">k</span>â€™th
    sequence and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{z}_0 \,
    \cdots \, \textrm{z}_{\textrm{Z}-1}$</span> is a
    space-separated integer set of the <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$Z$</span> animals.<br>
    The <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{Z}$</span> animals
    should be given in ascending order such that <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$\textrm{animal}_\textrm {j} \leq
    \textrm{z}_{\textrm{j}+1}$</span> for all <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$\textrm{z} \, \epsilon \, \{ \, 0\, ,\cdots
    \, ,\textrm{Z}-1\, \} $</span>.</p>
